### - Project Title:
## "Python Interactive Dictionary"
                  
### - Project Description:

- I've applied my knowledge of what I have learned after 2 weeks of basics in Python to create my First Python Project : "Python Interactive Dictionary".
- Applied what I've learned on 2 weeks i.e. conditional statements, looping, importing libraries, lists/dictionaries and more.
- This dictionary gives the meaning of the word we input.
- The program executes when we press "\end".

As a begineer, it is a console based project but I'll surely upgrade it later on a web app, using database and django after learning them.

See how it looks like:
