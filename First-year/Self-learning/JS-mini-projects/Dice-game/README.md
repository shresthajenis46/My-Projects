### - Project-description:

- I've applied my knowledge of what I have learned after 3 weeks of basics in JavaScript to create my First Dice Game Project.
- Applied what I've learned on 3 weeks i.e. DOM manipulation.
- This game announces winner on the basis of dice thrown on every refresh of the page.
- The game shows draw if the number in the dice matches.
